1.> Introduction

This readme is intended to describe the requirements to compile and
run the code PIXIE3D. PIXIE3D solves the extended magnetohydro-
dynamics (MHD) equations in 3D arbitrary geometries using fully
implicit Newton-Krylov algorithms. The code employs the open-source
PETSc library for parallelization, and the HDF5 library for data
management. It is primarily used to study plasma behavior in magnetic
confinement fusion devices. The spatial discretization of the MHD
equations in PIXIE3D is described in Ref. [1]. Details of the temporal
discretization can be found in Refs. [2-5].

2.> Requirements

We proceed to describe the minimum requirements to compile and run
PIXIE3D.

2.1> Compilers

The serial version of PIXIE3D (pixie3d.x) only requires a Fortran
90/95 compiler. PIXIE3D has been compiled and tested with Absoft,
Lahey, and Intel f95 compilers. Others will be added in time.

The parallel version of PIXIE3D (pixie3d.petsc.x) requires an ANSI C
compiler in addition to the fortran compiler. In addition, certain
libraries need to be present. We proceed to discuss these next.

2.2> External libraries

The serial version of PIXIE3D does not require any external
libraries. The parallel version currently uses PETSC 2.2.0 for
parallelization (http://www.anl??).

Advanced graphics postprocessing in 3D requires HDF5 libraries
(v. 1.6.2. and associated tools; http://??). Such libraries allows
the user to generate an HDF5 format file, readable by the LLNL
graphics interpreter Visit (see next section).

All these libraries contain documentation as to how to compile them
and test them, and these are not reproduced here in the interest of
brevity.

2.3> Graphics

PIXIE3D comes with its own postprocessor, called pixplot.x. This file
will take output from PIXIE3D and generate various files with time traces,
contour plots (viewable with Xdraw) and fully 3D plots (in HDF5 format,
which can be viewed with the free Visit software). We proceed to describe 
the visualization software below.

2.3.1> Xdraw

Xdraw is a free, simple (yet powerful) 1D and 2D plotter (included in
this electronic distribution). The postprocessor "pixplot.x" will
always generate xdraw files for 2D contour plots, even in 3D runs. The
user can choose how to slice the solution among the main logical
coordinate axes (see Sec. 5.1 below).

Xdraw is invoked with "xdraw [keyword]", where "keyword" can be "car"
(for cartesian coordinate plots, "cnv" for contravariant component
plots, "cov" for covariant component plots, "diag" for diagnostic
plots, "pert" for perturbation plots, and "gamma" for time histories
of various diagnostics (described in Sec. 5.1 below). When invoked,
xdraw reads the file draw[keyword].in to read its configuration, and
plot accordingly. These draw*.in files are generated automatically by
pixplot.x.

2.3.2> Visit

This is an open source, freely available visualization solfware
developed at LLNL. An interface has been developed for PIXIE3D to
render 2D and 3D plots generated by the latter. Version 1.5.2 or later
is required, and can be obtained from

"http://www.llnl.gov/VisIt/home.html"

3.> Installation instructions

PIXIE3D is easy to install. Just execute:

tar xzvf pixie3d.tar.gz

to generate the directory structure, and change directories into
"pixie3d".  From there, type:

# make setup

to setup all required compilation files.

4.> Compilation instructions

In order to compile PIXIE3D, the user will need to edit the Makefile
in the main distribution directory to setup some system-dependent
variables, such as the installation directory for PETSC (PETSC_DIR; if
a parallel compilation is required) and that for the HDF5 distribution
(HDF5_HOME; if an HDF5 file is to be generated after postprocessing).

Currently, PIXIE3D has been successfully compiled in Linux OS with
three different compilers: Absoft f90, Lahey lf95, and Intel
ifort. More compilers will be tested in the future.

4.1> Serial compilation

For a serial compilation, type

# make distclean
# make

For testing serially, type:

# make serial-tests

4.2> Parallel compilation

Linking against the PETSC library requires one to set the variable
BOPT to either "g" (debugging) or "O" (optimized). For production
runs, "O" should normally be used, and one should type

# make BOPT=O distclean
# make BOPT=O pixie3d
# make BOPT=O pixplot

to generate pixie3d.petsc.x and pixplot.petsc.x (the parallel
postprocessor).  At this point, testing is not available for the
parallel version.

4.3> Special Makefile flags

There are several specific purpose flags in the makefile that one can
invoke when compiling PIXIE3D. These are:

FC: to set the fortran compiler (default is f90) 

OPT: to set the optimization level. Can be set to "g" (debugging), "O"
(optimized), "p" (profiling), "s" (static; for Absoft only), and "v"
(verbose), and combinations (e.g. one can set OPT=Opv to combine
optimization with profiling and verbose options).

VECPOT: if set, the vector potential version of PIXIE3D will be
compiled, generating the executables "pixie3d_a.x" and "pixplot_a.x"

VMEC: if set, the contributed VMEC interface for 3D Tokamak and
Stellarator equibria will be compiled and linked. This interface is 
physically located under the "contrib" directory.

5.> Using PIXIE3D

5.1> Input file

Before execution, the user should set the input file, "pixie3d.in". 
Defaults are provided within PIXIE3D for all quantities,
which are explained in the readInput.F file. An excerpt of this file
is included in App. 1 (for pixie3d.x) and App. 2 (for pixplot.x).

5.2> Serial execution

Serial execution requires the user simply to type:

# ./pixie3d.x (or ./pixie3d_a.x for the vector potential version).

After completion of the run, the user should invoke:

# ./pixplot.x (or ./pixplot_a.x)

for postprocessing. Plots can be viewed by invoking xdraw or visit (if
an HDF5 file has been created).

5.3> Parallel execution

Parallel execution will be largely dependent on the MPI distribution
that has been used to compile PETSc, and on the availability of a
queue management system. With mpich-1.2.5.2, one would
type, for instance:

# mpirun [mpi options] pixie3d.petsc.x -snes_mf [petsc options]

Several mpirun options are available according to the MPI
distribution. Similarly with PETSC. The option "-snes_mf" (which
indicates that a Jacobian-free approach is to be used) is
mandatory. Specific PETSC options for PIXIE3D include:

     OUTPUT CONTROL:                                     
        -ilevel <ilevel>: level of output info          
                                                         
     SOLVER:                                             
	-asm_PC: use an additive Schwartz (ASM) preconditioner
        -aspc_its <its>: number of ASM iterations        
        -id_PC: identity preconditioner                  
                                                         
     TIME STEPPING:                                      
        -nmax <nmax>: number of time steps     
        -tmax <tmax>: final time                         
                                                         
     PARALLEL DA:                                        
        -npx: processors in X direction                  
        -npy: processors in Y direction                  
        -npz: processors in Z direction                  

5.4> Postprocessing

Postprocessing is done with pixplot.x (or any of the following
variants: pixplot_a.x for vector potential version; pixplot.petsc.x
for parallel version; and pixplot_a.petsc.x for parallel vector
potential version).

pixplot.x is configured via the namelist "graphdef", also located in
the file "pixie3d.in". The components of the namelist are described in
App. 2. 

The serial postprocessor can be used to postprocess serial or parallel
runs (provided the information fits in memory). However, the parallel
postprocessor cannot be used to postprocess serial runs (unless it
employs only one processor).

The parallel postprocessor does not require any runtime options. If
postprocessing is done in parallel, one needs to use the same number
of processors as were used with pixie3d.petsc.x. Furthermore, XDRAW
contour plots are not generated (although time histories still are),
and the HDF5 file pixie3d.h5 is generated instead. This file can be
interpreted using the freely available graphics software Visit.
