      SUBROUTINE DSRCOM (RSAV, ISAV, JOB)
C***BEGIN PROLOGUE  DSRCOM
C***SUBSIDIARY
C***PURPOSE  Save/restore ODEPACK COMMON blocks.
C***LIBRARY   MATHLIB (ODEPACK)
C***TYPE      REAL*8 (SSRCOM-S, DSRCOM-D)
C***AUTHOR  Hindmarsh, Alan C., (LLNL)
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  This routine saves or restores (depending on JOB) the contents of
C  the COMMON block DLS001, which is used internally
C  by one or more ODEPACK solvers.
C
C  RSAV = real array of length 218 or more.
C  ISAV = integer array of length 37 or more.
C  JOB  = flag indicating to save or restore the COMMON blocks:
C         JOB  = 1 if COMMON is to be saved (written to RSAV/ISAV)
C         JOB  = 2 if COMMON is to be restored (read from RSAV/ISAV)
C         A call with JOB = 2 presumes a prior call with JOB = 1.
