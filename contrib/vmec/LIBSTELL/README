It is IMPORTANT -  !!! ESSENTIAL !!! (for consistency with UNIX systems) that ALL
FORTRAN FILES containing MODULE FILES have names consisting of ONLY LOWER CASE letters
and numbers.

The problem is with the dependency file (*.dep) and the fact that UNIX systems
do NOT respect upper case letter in the compiled module files.

Also, DO NOT put more than one module into a *.f file. The *.f file MUST have the
name of the module in lower case.
